# odin-recipes

This is an exercise from The Odin Project Foundation Course. The goal is to build a recipe website with only HTML. The website should have a home page that links to 3 recipe pages.

This has successfully been completed and allows me to demonstrate the following skills:

- Ability to build HTML pages from scratch
- Ability to use the VSCode environment
- Ability to use Emmet Abbreviations for quicker page building.
- Ability to use the command line interface to create, read, copy and move files.
- Ability to use Git via the terminal and use GitHub after using the push command.
- Ability to respect copyrights and accredit sources of information.
