        <h3> Crispy baked chicken wings offer the crunch of fried chicken without deep frying</h3>
        <br>
        <p>You can also make these wings crisp in your air fryer too! </p>
        <br>
        <p>If you enjoy mild buffalo wings but want to switch things up a bit, then these offer a unique alternative</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat the chicken wings dry, mix the spices and toss the chicken to coat.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place wings on a parchment-paper lined baking sheet or a baking sheet with a cooling rack. Cook the wings in the oven for 20-25 minutes per side. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Add all ingredients for the sauce to a small bowl. Whisk to incorporate.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add the wings to a bowl with some of the sauce and toss to coat. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Adjust the bake time for added crispiness. The longer you cook your wings in the oven, the crispier they will become. For saucy wings, I tend to keep my chicken in for closer to 25 minutes per side so that they can still be slightly crisp after I add the hot honey Old Bay sauce. </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
