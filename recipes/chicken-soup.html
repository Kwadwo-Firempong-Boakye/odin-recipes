        <h3> Satisfyingly rich and intensely flavored.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Soup is not just a winter food. In Jamaica and Africa, we serve soup no matter the outside temperature. So you can enjoy this meal any time and any place. The best part is that this chicken soup recipe allows for endless tweaking for your perfect soup. You can adjust it to your preferences. Simply add more vegetables, different vegetables, or extra peppers to make it spicy. </p>
        <br>
        <p>As the soup cooks down, the starches from the pumpkin and potatoes thicken the broth into the perfect creamy texture that we love in our soups. With this recipe, you will ‌enjoy this dish as much as my friends and I do. </p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken Feet</strong> – Chop the nails off of the chicken feet, be sure to cut a little bit higher than the nail to ensure you get all of it. Wash the feet with water or a mixture of lemon and or vinegar. Rinse well.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Chop Vegetables</strong> – Peel the pumpkin with a knife and cut it into bite-sized chunks. Dice the celery and carrot. Chop slices of sweet corn and then quarter the pieces. Set all this aside. Finely chop the onion and green onion.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Saute</strong> - In your soup pot, heat some oil, add onion, garlic, and thyme, and saute until fragrant (about 1-2 minutes). Then go in with the celery and green onions and saute for another minute.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Add Chicken Feet</strong> – Add the chicken feet, scotch bonnet (if you like it spicy), and chicken bouillon powder. Add a cup of water and allow it to boil for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Add the Roots</strong> – Once the chicken boils for 5 minutes, throw in the pumpkin, potatoes, and the rest of the water (about 4 cups). Stir occasionally and let the pot come to a boil for 30 minutes. As the soup cooks, season with salt to taste, and add more water if you need to.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Finishing Touches</strong> – 10 minutes or so before you’re ready to serve, add the carrot and corn. Continue stirring and let the soup cook until all the vegetables are tender.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong> – Once everything is the texture and consistency you like, serve it hot next to your favorite bread.</li>
            <br>
        </ol>
