        <h3>Popular and spicy West African chicken and rice dish.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Jollof-Rice is probably the most famous West African dish. Its long-grain rice spiced up with tomatoes, onions, bell pepper, garlic, and thyme, then simmered in a delicious chicken broth for a flavor-packed comfort food guaranteed to soothe your soul.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Cameroon, Nigeria, and Ghana all have their unique twist to this deliciousness. The recipes from Cameroon and Nigeria use long-grain rice, while Ghanaians use basmati and add more tomatoes. But I see no reason to fight about it because they’re all fabulous.</p>
